# bear-level-2
In this solution I adopted the use of a Participant which deploys the contract and pays the whitelist member and a API that allows just 2 participants to interact with it, the first to interact with this api gets a spot in the whitelist
and gets 2000 units of the non network token.

I also used the api technology to make my work peculiar and also cause i hit a block while trying to complete the level 3 task due to lack time and my little resources.
